"aminoglycoside"	"Aminoglycosides are a group of antibiotics that are mostly effective against Gram-negative bacteria. These molecules consist of aminated sugars attached to a dibasic cyclitol. Aminoglycosides work by binding to the bacterial 30S ribosomal subunit (some work by binding to the 50S subunit), inhibiting the translocation of the peptidyl-tRNA from the A-site to the P-site and also causing misreading of mRNA, leaving the bacterium unable to synthesize proteins vital to its growth."	"armA"	"ArmA is a 16S rRNA methyltransferase that targets mature or nearly mature 30S subunits. It transfers a methyl group from S-adenosyl-L-methionine to N7-G1405 of the 16S rRNA, an aminoglycoside binding site."
